## Introduction

This repository is designed to help you get started with PySpark on Databricks. It includes examples for common data engineering, data science, and machine learning workflows using Spark, as well as tips for optimizing your code on the Databricks environment.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need:

1. Access to a Databricks workspace.
2. Basic understanding of Apache Spark and PySpark.
3. Familiarity with Python.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- Databricks workspace account
- Familiarity with Spark concepts (RDDs, DataFrames, etc.)

### Setting Up a Databricks Cluster

To run the PySpark code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Create a new cluster on Databricks.
2. Install required libraries (PySpark is included by default, but you can add additional libraries via PyPI or Maven).

## Installation

If you're developing locally and using Databricks Connect, follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install databricks-connect
   ```
2. Configure the Databricks Connect tool to interact with your Databricks workspace:
   ```bash
   databricks-connect configure
   ```

For more detailed steps on configuring Databricks Connect, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/databricks-connect.html).

## Usage

### Running PySpark Code in Databricks

You can run PySpark code by creating notebooks in Databricks. Below is an example of how to create a simple PySpark DataFrame:

```python
# Sample PySpark Code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("example").getOrCreate()

# Create DataFrame
data = [("Alice", 34), ("Bob", 45), ("Cathy", 29)]
columns = ["Name", "Age"]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)

# Show DataFrame
df.show()
```

### Running Locally with Databricks Connect

To execute PySpark code from your local machine using Databricks Connect, use the following pattern:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Connect to your Databricks cluster
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("local-example").getOrCreate()

# Example: Load data from Databricks File System (DBFS)
df = spark.read.csv("/dbfs/path/to/file.csv")

# Perform transformations
df_filtered = df.filter(df['column_name'] > 10)

# Show results
df_filtered.show()
```

## Example Notebooks

- **Data Engineering Examples**: Common data manipulation tasks such as filtering, joining, and aggregating DataFrames.
- **Machine Learning with PySpark**: End-to-end machine learning workflows using MLlib, Sparkâ€™s machine learning library.
- **Optimizing Spark Jobs**: Tips and techniques for optimizing PySpark jobs for performance and cost efficiency.
